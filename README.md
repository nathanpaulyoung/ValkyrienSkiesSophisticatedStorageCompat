# ValkyrienSkies 2 + SophisticateStorage Compatibility Mod

Just a small, simple mod to fix duplication of items in Sophisticated Storage containers when Valkyrien Skies applies physics to them.

A compatibility fix in SophisticatedStorage or ValkyrienSkies 2 would be a preferrable approach, but until that is in place, this mod can bridge the gap.

## Version Support
Updated for Minecraft 1.20.1 to patch Sophisticated Storage 0.10 and should work with any version of Valkyrien Skies 2. 1.18 and 1.19 support can be found on the [upstream repository](https://github.com/dwayn/ValkyrienSkiesSophisticatedStorageCompat/releases) or on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valkyrienskiessophisticatedstoragecompat).
